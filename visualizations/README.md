## Usage

All plots are automatically generated when running the Streamlit application. The plots are saved in PNG format with high resolution (300 DPI) for publication quality.

## Reproduction

To regenerate all visualizations:

1. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Experiment with different parameters in the sidebar

3. Screenshots and plots will be automatically saved to this directory

## Technical Details

- **Format**: PNG with 300 DPI resolution
- **Color Scheme**: Plotly default with high contrast
- **Font Size**: Optimized for readability in presentations
- **Accessibility**: Colors chosen to be colorblind-friendly

## Analysis Notes

### Model Performance
- Training typically converges within 30 seconds on CPU
- Memory usage is minimal due to Fourier feature compression
- Real-time inference is possible for interactive applications

### Feature Engineering Insights
- Low-frequency Fourier modes contain most signal information
- Higher modes primarily contain noise
- Optimal balance found around k=20 modes for this signal type

### Applications
- Plots demonstrate real-world applicability
- Performance metrics suitable for production deployment
- Visualizations aid in model interpretability and debugging
